Configuration must be filled before running the file.
   * jsmAPIKey can be set as one's DefaultAPIKey or one can add a new API and set its apiKey.
   * SIGSCI_EMAIL and SIGSCI_PASSWORD are needed for providing authentication to Signal Sciences. One should enter their Signal Science credentials there.
